# Docker PHP-FPM 8.1 & Nginx 1.20 on Alpine Linux

* Built on the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux distribution
* Very small Docker image size (+/-35MB)
* Uses PHP 8 for better performance, lower CPU usage & memory footprint
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's on-demand PM)
* The servers Nginx, PHP-FPM and supervisord run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs

This image is built on GitHub actions and hosted on the GitHub Docker images repo. It is also available under `khromov/alpine-nginx-php8` on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/khromov/alpine-nginx-php8).

### Usage

Fetch the prebuilt image in your custom images:

GitHub (preferred):

```
docker pull ghcr.io/khromov/alpine-nginx-php8/alpine-nginx-php8:latest
```

If you get "no basic auth credentials", see [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages).


Docker Hub:

```
docker pull khromov/alpine-nginx-php8
```

Not preferred since the image is not up to date due to Docker removing free build CI. PR welcome to add a GitHub action for pushing images to Docker Hub directly.


#### Start Nginx, PHP and MySQL via docker-compose

This is convenient for developing Laravel, WordPress or Drupal sites. It includes MySQL and phpMyAdmin

```
docker-compose up
```

Now you can access your site at http://localhost:8080 and the MySQL database at `db:3306`.

The folder `./src-compose` will be created and you can put your project files there.

The urls are:
* Web: http://localhost:8080
* phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:8081

###### File permission issues

If you copied files into `./src-compose` you need to run:

```
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup ./src-compose
sudo chmod -R 777 ./src-compose
```

This makes sure that the files have the correct owner inside the container but remain writable outside of it.

#### Quick build / run

```
docker build . -t php8
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t php8
```

Go to:  
http://localhost:8080/

## Configuration
In [config/](config/) you'll find the default configuration files for Nginx, PHP and PHP-FPM.
If you want to extend or customize that you can do so by mounting a configuration file in the correct folder.
